abstract: Wide-field H α images of the Galactic plane have revealed a new
  supernova remnant (SNR) nearly 3 deg in diameter centred at l = 107.0, b =
  +9.0. Deep and higher resolution H α and [O III] 5007 Å images show dozens of
  H α filaments along the remnant's northern, western, and southwestern limbs,
  but few [O III] bright filaments. The nebula is well detected in the H α
  Virginia Tech Spectral-Line Survey images, with many of its brighter filaments
  even visible on Digital Sky Survey images. Low-dispersion spectra of several
  filaments show either Balmer dominated, non-radiative filaments, or the more
  common SNR radiative filaments with [S II]/H α ratios above 0.5, consistent
  with shock-heated line emission. Emission line ratios suggest shock velocities
  ranging from ≤70 km s-1 along its western limb to ≃ 100 km s-1 along its
  northwestern boundary. While no associated X-ray emission is seen in ROSAT
  images, faint 1420 MHz radio emission appears coincident with its western and
  northern limbs. Based on an analysis of the remnant's spatially resolved H α
  and [O III] emissions, we estimate the remnant's distance at ˜1.5-2.0 kpc
  implying a physically large (dia. = 75-100 pc) and old (90-110 × 103 yr) SNR
  in its post-Sedov radiative phase of evolution expanding into a low-density
  interstellar medium (n0 = 0.05-0.2 cm-3) and lying some 250-300 pc above the
  Galactic plane.
