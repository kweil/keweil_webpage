abstract: Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is one of the best studied young Galactic
  supernova remnants. While it provides a rare opportunity to study in detail
  the remnant of a supernova (SN) type IIb, questions remain regarding the
  nature of its progenitor, its mass-loss history, and its pre-SN evolution.
  Here we present an optical investigation of the circumstellar environment
  around Cas A and find clumpy and filamentary Hα emission nebulosities
  concentrated 10-15 pc (10'-15') to the north and east. First reported by
  Minkowski as a faint H II region, these nebulosities exhibit distinct
  morphological and spectroscopic properties relative to the surrounding diffuse
  emissions. Compared to neighboring H II regions, these nebulae show stronger
  [N II] 6548, 6583 Å and [S II] 6716, 6731 Å emissions relative to Hα. We show
  that Cas A's highest-velocity ejecta knots are interacting with some of the
  closest projected emission nebulae, thus providing strong evidence that these
  nebulae lie at the same distance as the remnant. We interpret these
  surrounding nebulosities to be the remains of the progenitor's red supergiant
  wind, which accumulated against the southern edge of a large extended H II
  region located north of Cas A. Our findings are consistent with the view that
  Cas A's progenitor underwent considerable mass loss, first from a fast
  main-sequence wind, then from a slower, clumpy red supergiant wind, and
  finally from a brief high-velocity wind, like that from a yellow supergiant.
